[LIQUIDIUM]

Overview of Liquidium:
Liquidium is a pioneering peer-to-peer Bitcoin lending platform that allows users to borrow BTC using their Ordinals (unique Bitcoin-based digital assets) as collateral. Operating natively on the Bitcoin Layer-1 blockchain, Liquidium leverages Bitcoin’s unique capabilities to facilitate secure and decentralized lending.

How Liquidium Works:
- **Ordinals as Collateral**: Users can borrow BTC by putting up their Ordinals as collateral on Liquidium. Popular Ordinal collections accepted include RSIC Metaprotocol, Bitcoin Frogs, NodeMonkes, and Ordinal Maxi Biz (OMB).
- **Short-Term Loans**: Loans on Liquidium are short-term, typically maturing in 7-12 days. If the borrower fails to repay, the lender receives the borrower's Ordinal as collateral.
- **Advanced Bitcoin Technologies**: Liquidium utilizes Discreet Log Contracts (DLCs) and Partially Signed Bitcoin Transactions (PSBTs) to facilitate secure lending on the Bitcoin Layer-1 blockchain.

Key Features and Use Cases:
- **Instant BTC Liquidity**: Borrowers can obtain instant BTC liquidity by locking their Ordinals in a DLC until repayment, allowing them to meet short-term liquidity needs without selling their Ordinals.
- **Interest Earnings for Lenders**: Lenders can earn interest on their idle BTC by lending it out on Liquidium.
- **Integration with Magic Eden Wallet**: Liquidium has partnered with Magic Eden Wallet to offer a 1.25x points boost for Magic Eden wallet users who lend or borrow on the platform. These points are not currently redeemable for tokens.

Ordinals’ Role in Liquidium:
- **Core Collateral Asset**: Ordinals serve as the primary collateral asset that enables borrowing on Liquidium. By inscribing unique digital assets onto the Bitcoin blockchain, Ordinals provide a secure and verifiable way to back loans.
- **Security and Transparency**: The use of Ordinals ensures that each loan is backed by a unique and traceable asset. This adds a layer of security and transparency to the lending process.
- **Diverse Collateral Options**: By accepting a variety of popular Ordinal collections, Liquidium offers flexibility and options for borrowers, enhancing the platform’s usability.
